Refunds and Settlements
=======================

This section covers refund processing and settlement management with the Cardinity Python SDK, including full refunds, partial refunds, and settlement operations.

Overview
--------

Refund and settlement operations include:

1. **Full Refunds**: Refund the entire payment amount
2. **Partial Refunds**: Refund a portion of the payment amount
3. **Multiple Refunds**: Process multiple partial refunds for one payment
4. **Settlement Management**: Handle authorization settlements
5. **Void Operations**: Cancel unsettled authorizations

Basic Refund Processing
----------------------

Here's how to process refunds:

.. code-block:: python

   """
   Basic Refund Example
   
   This example demonstrates how to process refunds for payments.
   """

   import os
   from cardinity import Cardinity, CardinityError

   # Initialize client
   cardinity = Cardinity(
       consumer_key=os.getenv("CARDINITY_CONSUMER_KEY", "your_consumer_key_here"),

Multiple Partial Refunds
------------------------

Handle multiple partial refunds for a single payment:

.. code-block:: python

   def process_multiple_refunds():

       print(f"\nüí∞ Original payment: {payment['amount']} EUR")
       print("Processing multiple partial refunds...")
       
       # Define refund scenarios
       refund_scenarios = [
           {"amount": "15.00", "reason": "Shipping refund"},
           {"amount": "10.00", "reason": "Product discount"},
           {"amount": "5.00", "reason": "Service fee refund"}
       ]
       
       total_refunded = 0.0
       successful_refunds = []
       
       for scenario in refund_scenarios:
           print(f"\n   üîÑ Processing refund: {scenario['amount']} EUR - {scenario['reason']}")
           
           refund = create_partial_refund(
               payment['id'],

               scenario['reason']
           )
           
           if refund and refund['status'] == 'approved':
               successful_refunds.append(refund)
               total_refunded += float(scenario['amount'])
               print(f"      ‚úÖ Refund successful")
           else:
               print(f"      ‚ùå Refund failed")
       
       print(f"\nüìä Refund Summary:")

       return successful_refunds

Refund Status Management
-----------------------

Handle different refund statuses:

.. code-block:: python

   def check_refund_status(refund_id):
       """Check and handle refund status."""
       
       try:
           refund = cardinity.get_refund(refund_id)

           else:
               print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown refund status: {status}")
           
           return refund
           
       except CardinityError as e:
           print(f"‚ùå Failed to check refund status: {e}")
           return None

   def monitor_refund_processing(refund_id, max_checks=10, interval=30):
       """Monitor refund processing until completion."""

           if refund['status'] in ['approved', 'declined']:
               print(f"‚úÖ Refund processing completed with status: {refund['status']}")
               return refund
               
           print(f"   Still pending... checking again in {interval} seconds")
           time.sleep(interval)
       
       print("‚ö†Ô∏è Refund monitoring timed out")
       return None

Production Considerations
-----------------------

Important considerations for production use:

1. **Refund Policies**: Implement clear refund policies and time limits
2. **Amount Validation**: Ensure refunds don't exceed original payment amounts
3. **Status Tracking**: Monitor refund processing status and timing
4. **Customer Communication**: Notify customers of refund status changes
5. **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed logs of all refund operations
6. **Business Rules**: Implement business-specific refund logic
7. **Settlement Timing**: Manage authorization settlement windows properly
8. **Error Handling**: Handle all possible error scenarios gracefully

Next Steps
----------

After implementing refunds and settlements:

1. **Webhook Integration**: Set up webhooks for refund status updates
2. **Customer Portal**: Allow customers to track refund status
3. **Analytics**: Monitor refund rates and patterns
4. **Automation**: Automate refund processing based on business rules
5. **Compliance**: Ensure refund processes meet regulatory requirements
